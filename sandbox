Hi! 👋

You’ve opened the IDE Sandbox. 🎉

This means that you launched the IDE from a lesson that isn't a lab, and
while you’re in the IDE Sandbox the IDE WILL NOT save files or directories
created here. 💨

In other words, the “Sandbox” is just that: a temporary place to “play” with
code. If you want to store anything created here, be sure to back it up to a
repository on GitHub.
